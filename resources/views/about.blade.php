<p class="mt-8">My name is John, I’m 34, and I’ve been building on the web since I was 14. Like many others, I started out with Microsoft Frontpage and a boy's dream of making a web page with links to all my favorite Quake 2 skins. Naturally, I had so much fun doing it that it remained a side hobby for about a decade. During that time I continued learning more about my new craft from articles, books, youtube, podcasts, and whatever else I could get my hands on.</p>

{{-- <p class="mt-8">Around 2009, I got my first job as a “real” designer/developer. Since then, I've worked my way from making simple brochure-style websites with basic HTML/CSS sprinkled with a little bit of jQuery and PHP, to small applications with Codeigniter and jQuery/Mootools, to bigger applications with Laravel and React/Vue.</p> --}}

<p class="mt-8">Today, I am part of a small remote software company in the healthcare space. There I envision, present, plan, design, and then build about half of the pieces of our SAAS product. We build/sell a “patient experience platform”, which is really just marketing-speak for surveys. There’s more to it than that of course with EMR integration, heathcare compliance, incident management, etc. But you get the idea.</p>

<p class="mt-8">In my off-hours, I travel full-time with my family of 5 in our RV. We’ve spent the last year and a half exploring and learning about our beautiful nation.
